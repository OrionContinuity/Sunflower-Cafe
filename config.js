/* Sunflower Café — site config.

   These two values are PUBLIC by design. The publishable key ships in every
   page load; it is not a secret. What actually protects the data is the
   database itself: public tables are read-only to anon with zero write
   policies, sf_orders and sf_events have no select policy at all, and every
   write goes through a security-definer RPC. See supabase-setup.sql.

   Never put a service_role / sb_secret_ key in this file. It bypasses all of
   the above and would be handed to every visitor.

   Leave both blank to run in STATIC mode: the baked-in menu renders and the
   pre-order form falls back to a pre-filled email. */
